<title>Tails</title>
</head><body>Tails<br/>
<br/>
- the most used privacy focused live operating system<br/>
- runs on almost any computer<br/>
- free software<br/>
- based on debian<br/>
- can use Tor or I2P<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">- defaults to Tor</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"></li>
</ul>
- all traffic is sent through Tor<br/>
<br/>
- does not store info on hard drive<br/>
<br/>
- comes with many encryption options<br/>
<br/>
- can be booted from VM or live media<br/>
&#09;- VM option is less secure as host and guest may contaminate each other<br/>
&#09;- works better in Virtualbox<br/>
<br/>
- do not enable shared folders or clipboard<br/>
<br/>
- resizable window and shared clipboard only work if VM is configured to use 32bit<br/>
<br/>
- the fastest and easiest way to a reasonably secure OS that provides access to anonymizing services<br/>
<br/>
- Tails + Tor can give people a false sense of security<br/>
&#09;- it is not good enough by itself<br/>
<br/>
- Tails inherits the flaws of the software it comes bundled with<br/>
&#09;- no user should put full trust into any particular security solution<br/>
&#09;- trust should be distributed amongst several methods<br/>
&#09;- Tails is just a piece of an anonymizing solution<br/>
<br/>
- Tails is much better than just using Tor browser in Windows<br/>
&#09;- provides isolation and a separate security domain<br/>
<br/>
- Tails wont protect you from<br/>
&#09;- firmware rootkits or bios attacks<br/>
&#09;- hardware compromises<br/>
&#09;&#09;- hardware keyloggers and VGA spies<br/>
&#09;- has a unique OS fingerprint<br/>
&#09;&#09;- easily identifiable by knowledgable people<br/>
<br/>
- Tails does not encrypt your documents by default<br/>
&#09;- except in the encrypted persistent volume<br/>
&#09;- provides tools to encrypt your files<br/>
<br/>
- You may leave traces of your activities if you access your hard drive from tails<br/>
<br/>
- Tails does not clear metadata from documents<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">- does not encrypt email by default</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"></li>
</ul>
- Do not use the same Tails session for multiple identities<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">- connection info may correlate aliases</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"></li>
</ul>
- Searches for Tails and downloads are logged by the NSA and other nation states<br/>
&#09;- you will be marked for more active monitoring by the government<br/>
<br/>
- lack of isolation<br/>
&#09;- Torification happens within the OS<br/>
&#09;- would be safer if Torification happens on a hardware router or virtual gateway<br/>
&#09;- Tor enforcing proxy needs to be hosted on another device<br/>
<br/>
- PCs running Tor have hardware information that can be linked to the user<br/>
&#09;- virtual machines hide hardware serials<br/>
&#09;&#09;- creates a virtual hard drive that only runs when the OS is running<br/>
<br/>
- during startup, hit tab and enter I2P to set I2P as the anonymization method<br/>
