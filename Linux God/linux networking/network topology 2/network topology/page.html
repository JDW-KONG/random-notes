<br/>
Switching<br/>
- switch: forwards packets within the internal network<br/>
- switch: used for lan traffic<br/>
- router: connects to internet<br/>
<br/>
- the path from the client to the gateway is the default route<br/>
&#09;- the router is the gateway<br/>
<br/>
- we don't need the router to transmit info on the LAN<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Routing<br/>
- routers facilitate traffic between networks<br/>
- requests traverse the default route to connect to the internet<br/>
&#09;- request may traverse additional routers and networks before it reaches its destination<br/>
&#09;- use the traceroute command to view your request's route<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cloud Server<br/>
- abstracts a lot of routing into software defined networking<br/>
- a simulation of a physical network</tt></body></html>
