</head><body>OSI Layers<br/>
<br/>
OSI<br/>
- open systems interconnection model<br/>
- conceptual model that standardizes network communication<br/>
- the goal is the interoperability of diverse communcation systems with standard protocols<br/>
- originally seven layers<br/>
- the model partitions a communication system into abstract layers<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Application Layer<br/>
- the interface permitting the user to send and receive daata through clients and applications<br/>
- HTTP, POP3, SMTP, DNS, SOAP<br/>
- verify that application is functional and DNS is correct<br/>
<br/>
Presentation Layer<br/>
- converts the request from the application into a universal format<br/>
- TLS, SSL, MIME, JPG, GIF<br/>
<br/>
Session Layer<br/>
- permits the ability to open, close, and manage a session between the process and response<br/>
- LDAP, NetBIOS, PPTP, RPC, SMB, SSL<br/>
<br/>
Transport Layer<br/>
- defines how data will be sent, providing validation and security<br/>
- TCP, UDP, SPX, iSCSI<br/>
- verify blocked (or damaged) ports, firewalls, and QoS<br/>
<br/>
Network Layer<br/>
- looks for the best path to reach the destination [ IP ]<br/>
- IP, IPSec, ICMP, RIP<br/>
- verify addressing and routing configuration, bandwidth, and authentication<br/>
<br/>
Data Link Layer<br/>
- handles communication between adjacent nodes<br/>
- Ethernet, Frame Relay, IEEE 802.11 (WiFi), PPP, VLAN, MAC<br/>
- verify switch and VLAN configuration as well as MAC addressing and IP conflicts<br/>
<br/>
Physical Layer<br/>
- handles bit level transmission between network nodes<br/>
- Ethernet physical, IEEE 1394 (firewire), infrared<br/>
- verify physical components</body></html>
