</head><body><tt>Routing<br/>
<br/>
- a router is a layer 3 device functioning at the IP level<br/>
<br/>
- a router forwards data packets between networks<br/>
<br/>
- the routing table is a static table mapping of the best path to a network destination<br/>
<br/>
- the routing table lists destinations and gateways for the networks the host belongs to<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Routing Table<br/>
- if the destination is outside the local network, use the gateway<br/>
- if the destination is inside the network, do no use the gateway<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Static Routes<br/>
- manually configured routes<br/>
- are for traffic that must not go through the default gateway<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BGP<br/>
- border gateway protocol<br/>
- routing protocol that routes traffic across the internet<br/>
- a layer 4 protocol sitting on top of TCP<br/>
&#09;- makes it simpler tha OSFP, as it doesn't manage what TCP handles<br/>
- there is no discovery; <ul><li style="list-style-type: none">-peers that have been manually configured to exchange routing information form a TCP connection</li>
</ul>
- organizations can use BGP for true multi-homing on their corporate network<br/>
<br/>
- An ASN (Autonomous SystemNumber) is required to implement BGP peering<br/>
&#09;- this is a special number assigned by IANA for use primarily with BGP<br/>
&#09;&#09;- identifies each network on the internet<br/>
<br/>
- two routers that have established a connection and exchanged BGP information are BGP peers<br/>
&#09;- they exchange routing info between them via BGP sessions over TCP<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion<br/>
- routerse connect different networks<br/>
- routing info is contained in a routing table<br/>
- static routes can be used for connections that can't (or shouldn't) use the default gateway<br/>
- BGP is the routing protocol that enables the internet to work</tt></body></html>
