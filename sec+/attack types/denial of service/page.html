<title>Denial of Service</title>
</head><body><span style="background-color: #00007f">Denial of Service</span><br/>
- <u>victim's machine or network is flooded with a high volume of request</u>s<br/>
&#09;- <u>this prevents other hosts from using the service</u><br/>
&#09;<br/>
&#09;- <u>common method is to use a SYN flood attack</u><br/>
&#09;&#09;- first two parts of the three way handshake take place<br/>
&#09;&#09;- this leaves your PC in a state of limbo<br/>
&#09;&#09;- DDoS attacks often involve a high volume of these<br/>
<br/>
- forcing a service to fail<br/>
&#09;- overload the service<br/>
<br/>
- take advantages of a design failure or vulnerability<br/>
&#09;- keep your systems patched<br/>
<br/>
- causing a system to be unavailable for a competitive advantage<br/>
<br/>
- create a smokescreen for some other exploit<br/>
&#09;- precursor to a DNS spoofing attack<br/>
<br/>
- doesn't have to be complicated<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="background-color: #00007f">A Friendly DoS</span><br/>
- unintentional DoSing<br/>
<br/>
- network DoS<br/>
&#09;- layer 2 loop without STP<br/>
<br/>
- Bandwidth DoS<br/>
&#09;- downloading multiple gigabyte linux distros over a DSL connection<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="background-color: #00007f">Distributed Denial of Service</span><br/>
- <u>a botnet is set up to flood a victim's system with an enormous amount of traffic</u><br/>
&#09;- this causes the system to go down or malfunctiion<br/>
<br/>
- launch an army of computers to bring down a service<br/>
&#09;- use all the bandwidth or resources - traffic spike<br/>
<br/>
- <u>this is why the bad guys have botnets</u><br/>
&#09;- droves of computers at their command<br/>
&#09;- at peak, Zeus botnet infected over 3.6 million PCs<br/>
&#09;- coordinated attack<br/>
<br/>
- asymmetric threat<br/>
&#09;- the attacker may have fewer resources than the victim<br/>
<br/>
- <u>stateful firewalls can be set up to prevent DDoS attacks from gaining access to your network</u><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="background-color: #00007f">DDoS Amplification</span><br/>
- a DNS amplification<br/>
&#09;- <u>DDoS attack in which the attacker exploits vulnerabilities in DNS servers to turn small queries into much larger payloads</u><br/>
&#09;- these payloads are used to bring down a victim's servers<br/>
<br/>
- turn your small attack into a big attack<br/>
&#09;- often reflected off another device or service<br/>
<br/>
- an increasingly common DDoS technique<br/>
&#09;- turn internet services against the victim<br/>
<br/>
- <u>uses protocols with few, if any, authentication checks</u><br/>
&#09;- NTP, DNS, ICMP<br/>
&#09;- a common example of protocol abuse</body></html>
