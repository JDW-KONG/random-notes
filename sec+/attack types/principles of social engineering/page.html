&#09;- there are ties connecting many organizations<br/>

<span style="background-color: #00007f">Social Engineering Principles</span><br/>
- Authority<br/>
&#09;- the social engineer appears to be in charge<br/>
&#09;- calls from helpdesk/CEO/police/etc.<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">- <u>impersonating an authority figure to solicit information from a victim</u></li>
</ul>
<br/>
- Intimidation<br/>
&#09;- there will be negative consequences if you don't comply<br/>
&#09;- <u>pretending to be someone of high authority and threatening the victim with consequences if they don't comply</u><br/>
&#09;- victims are made to believe they have no other choice<br/>
<br/>
- Consensus<br/>
&#09;- convince based on what's normally accepted<br/>
&#09;- <u>complying with demands because others appear to have done the same</u><br/>
&#09;- also known as social proof<br/>
<br/>
- Scarcity<br/>
&#09;- the situation will not be this way for long<br/>
&#09;- <u>setting a fake time limit or deadline that has to be met</u><br/>
<br/>
- Urgency<br/>
&#09;- works alongside scarcity<br/>
&#09;- act quickly, don't think<br/>
&#09;- <u>instills a sense of urgency and panic in the victim, causing them to comply amidst the confusion</u><br/>
<br/>
- Familiarity/Liking<br/>
&#09;- someone you know, we have common friends<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">- <u>the attacker makes himself familar to the victim</u></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">&#09;- <u>the attacker is eventually trusted and the attack begins&#09;</u></li>
</ul>
<br/>
- Trust<br/>
&#09;- someone who is safe<br/>
&#09;- <u>I'm from IT and I'm here to help</u></body></html>
