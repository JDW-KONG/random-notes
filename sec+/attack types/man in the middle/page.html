</head><body><span style="background-color: #00007f">Man in the Middle Attacks</span><br/>
- <u>attacker intercepts traffic going between two hosts and then changes the information in the packets in real time</u><br/>
&#09;- the man in the middle can inject false information between hosts<br/>
<br/>
- How can a bad guy watch you without knowing?<br/>
&#09;- man in the middle attacks<br/>
&#09;- sits between target and destination<br/>
<br/>
- redirects your traffic<br/>
&#09;- then passes it on the the destination<br/>
&#09;- you never know that your traffic was redirected<br/>
<br/>
- <u>ARP poisoning</u><br/>
&#09;- <u>ARP has no security</u><br/>
&#09;- operates at layer 2 of the OSI reference model<br/>
&#09;- uses MAC addresses<br/>
&#09;- must be done locally<br/>
<br/>
&#09;- <u>an attacker sends spoofed ARP messages to a local area network</u><br/>
&#09;&#09;- may allow an attacker to:<br/>
&#09;&#09;&#09;- intercept data frames on a network<br/>
&#09;&#09;&#09;- modify traffic<br/>
&#09;&#09;&#09;- stop all traffic<br/>
<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">- can be prevented by using IPSec tunnels across your internal network</li>
</ul>

<span style="background-color: #00007f">Man in the Browser</span><br/>
- <u>a trojan is used to intercept and manipulate calls between the main application's executable (the browser) and its security mechanisms</u><br/>
<br/>
- <u>the most common objective of this attack is to commit financial fraud by manipulating the transactions of internet banking systems</u><br/>
<br/>
- <u>kerberos prevents replay attacks, as it uses updated sequence numbers and timestamps</u><br/>
<br/>
- What if the middleman was on the same computer as the victim?<br/>
&#09;- the calls are coming from inside the browser<br/>
&#09;- malware/trojan does all of the proxy work<br/>
<br/>
- huge advantage to the bad guys<br/>
&#09;- relatively easy to proxy encrypted traffic<br/>
&#09;- everything looks normal to the victim<br/>
<br/>
- the man in the browser waits for you to log into your bank<br/>
&#09;- and the cleans you out<br/>

<span style="background-color: #00007f">Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption</span><br/>
- POODLE attack<br/>
<br/>
- <u>exploits the use of SSL 3.0 on legacy systems</u><br/>
<br/>
- <u>a downgrade attack is when you abandon a higher level of security for an older, low-level security system</u><br/>
