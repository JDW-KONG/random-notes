</span>- <u>when an exploit is found but there is no solution to prevent it</u><br/>
&#09;- <u>the only way to detect a zero day exploit is when you have previously taken a baseline of your computer so that you have a standard to compare to</u><br/>
&#09;- allows you to check the changes since the baseline<br/>

&#09;- <u>a vulnerability that has not been detected of published</u><br/>
&#09;- zero-day exploits are increasingly common<span style="background-color: #00007f"><br/>
</span><br/>
- many applications have vulnerabilities<br/>
&#09;- we just haven't found them yet<br/>
<br/>
- someone is working hard to find the next big vulnerability<br/>
&#09;- good guys share these with the developer<br/>
&#09;- bad guys keep these yet to be discovered holes to themselves<br/>
