<br/>
<span style="background-color: #00007f">Malware Hide and Go Seek</span><br/>
- traditional antivirus is very good at identifying known attacks<br/>
&#09;- checks the signature<br/>
&#09;- block anything that matches<br/>
<br/>
- there are still ways to infect and hide<br/>
&#09;- its a constant war<br/>
&#09;- new zero-days are constantly being discovered<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="background-color: #00007f">Your Drivers are Powerful</span><br/>
- <u>the interaction between the hardware and your operating system</u><br/>
&#09;- they are often trusted<br/>
&#09;- great opportunity for security issues<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- May 2016 - HP Audio Drivers<br/>
&#09;- conexant audio chips<br/>
&#09;- driver installation includes audio control software<br/>
&#09;- debugging feature enables a keylogger<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- hardware interactions contain sensitive information<br/>
&#09;- mousse, keyboard, camera, microphone<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="background-color: #00007f">Shimming</span><br/>
- <u>a shim is a small library that transparently intercepts API calls and changes the arguments passed</u><ul><li style="list-style-type: none">- <u>can also be used to run programs on different software platforms than they were developed for</u></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">- <u>normally used to help third party software applications work with an operating system</u></li>
</ul>
<br/>
- filling the space between two objects<br/>
&#09;- the middleman<br/>
<br/>
- Windows includes its own shim<br/>
&#09;- backwards compatibility with previous windows versions<br/>
&#09;- application compatibility shim cache<br/>
<br/>
- <u>malware authors write their own shims</u><br/>
&#09;- get around security like UAC<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="background-color: #00007f">Refactoring<br/>
</span>- <u>the process of changing a computer program's internal structure without modifying its external functional behavior or existing functionality</u><span style="background-color: #00007f"><br/>
</span><br/>
- metamorphic malware<br/>
&#09;- a different program is downloaded each time<br/>
<br/>
- makes it appear different each time<br/>
&#09;- add NOP instructions<br/>
&#09;- loops, pointless code strings<br/>
<br/>
- <u>can intelligently redesign itself</u><br/>
&#09;- reorder functions<br/>
&#09;- modify the application flow<br/>
&#09;- reorder code and insert unused data types<br/>
<br/>
- difficult to match with signature based detection<br/>
&#09;- use a layered approach<ul><li style="list-style-type: none"></li>
</ul>
